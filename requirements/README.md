## Requirements - NOTES



The `requirements-*.txt` files contained in this folder were auto-generated using [pipreqs](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs)

The main purpose of these requirements files is to show that the non-standard packages [spm1d](https://github.com/0todd0000/spm1d) and [power1d](https://github.com/0todd0000/power1d) (used in Jiku Power1D) require only standard packages:  NumPy, Scipy and Matplotlib.
